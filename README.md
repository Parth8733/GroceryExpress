# GroceryExpress

Nowdays, People are facing problem to go outside because of this virus (COVID-19). Grocery is neccery thing and for that people have to go outside which is very risky. so to overcome that problem i decided to make online grocery shopping website. in which customer gets free delivery to their house.
In this website i have created three role
1) Admin- who can manage all the thing, product management and can perform CRUD.
2) User - who can view the products and can perform CRUD on Orders Customer data.
3) DeliveryDriver - who can view the orders and can perfom CRUD on Drivers Data.
